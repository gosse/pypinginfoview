A console-based python ping tool, inspired by NirSoft [PingInfoView](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/multiple_ping_tool.html)


This is a rough, hacked together version that has pretty poor performance - but gets the job done. 

TODO: 
- text file input 
- async ping
- host - description format 
- better data structure (SQLite)?
- ~~IP/DNS lookup~~
- ~~set ping interval via cli~~
